### use `&`, `|`, `~` for logical operations on numpy arrays
### can use functions from `math`, `np` (numpy), and `ak` in the expression

## Note: hww has fake fj_isQCD=1.. However in below selection we do not select label_H_wwunmatch in training pool
selection: >-
    ((fj_sdmass > 100) & (fj_sdmass < 140))

### selection to apply at test time (i.e., when running w/ --predict)
# starting from v8: we have dedicated QCD and ttbar dataset for test only - they compose of 1/7 full events.
# for QCD: just use 1/2 of events
test_time_selection: >-
    ((fj_sdmass > 100) & (fj_sdmass < 140))
